A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) deploying and managing Jenkins agents on machines. It is configurable to integrate with a Jenkins charm deployed in another Juju model.

This charm simplifies the deployment and operations of Jenkins Agent on Kubernetes.

As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own agents whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the freedom to deploy on the platform of their choice.

For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Jenkins Agent simple and straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment into multiple environments for testing changes, and supports scaling out for enterprise deployments.

For information about how to deploy, integrate, and manage this charm, see the Official [jenkins-agent-k8s charm Documentation](https://charmhub.io/jenkins-agent-k8s/docs).
